# 📚 Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! 🚀 This Python-based application allows you to manage your personal library with ease. Whether you're looking to keep track of your book collection, remove old books, or store your library data for future use, this tool has got you covered. It’s simple, easy to use, and best of all, you don’t need to be a coding expert to use it!

## 🔧 Features

- **Add Books**: Add as many books as you like, and keep your collection growing!
- **Remove Books**: If you’re tired of a book, just remove it from your library with a click (well, not literally 😉).
- **List Books**: See a list of all your books stored in the library.
- **Persistent Storage**: All your books are saved to a CSV file, so your data stays safe and intact between sessions.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures your library is in check and everything is in order.
- **Simple Interface**: A fun and straightforward command-line interface for easy interaction.

## 🚀 How It Works

It’s super simple to start managing your library:

1. **Add a Book**: The system will ask if you'd like to add books to the library. Just type "YES" and give the name of your book.
2. **Remove a Book**: If you want to part ways with a book, just type "YES" when asked if you’d like to remove one, then provide the book's name.
3. **See Your Books**: At any time, you can display the list of books you've added, stored in a CSV file for permanent storage.
4. **CSV File**: All your book data is stored in a file called `storedData.csv` so you don’t lose anything!

## 📜 How to Use

Clone the repository, install Python (if you don’t already have it), and run the Python file to start managing your library!

### Steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd library-management-system
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python library_management.py
   ```

4. **Start managing your library** with simple prompts in the terminal.

### Example:

```python
phy_lib = library()

# Add books to your library
phy_lib.addingBook()

# Save your collection for later use
phy_lib.storedDataPermanently()

# Display your saved data
phy_lib.displayPermanentlyStoredData()

# Remove a book if you don't need it anymore
phy_lib.remBooks()

# Save your updated collection
phy_lib.storedDataPermanently()
```

## 🧑‍💻 Code Explanation

The `Library Management System` is built with simplicity in mind. Here's a breakdown of the code:
